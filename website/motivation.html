      Connect-5 (also known as Gomoku) is a 2-player, zero-sum board game normally played on a 15x15 grid.  The players alternate turns, placing a piece anywhere on the grid.  The first to have at least 5 pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins.<br><br>

We were inspired to create an AI for Connect-5 after both seeing Cris's Connect-4 parallel AI as well as reading about game state trees for tic-tac-toe.  Such zero-sum games are perfect candidates for minimax game state trees with further optimization from alpha-beta pruning.  An expansion to Connect-5 as compared to Connect-4 brings the follow challenges we seek to address with parallel approaches:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>The number of possible moves per turn increases by 20-30 fold depending on the size of the Connect-4 since pieces fall to the bottom in Connect-4 thus making Connect-4 moves 1D compared to the 2D possibilities of Connect-5.  This in turn magnifies our search space per ply as well.</li>

<li>With a larger search space, there will be more room for optimization, with possibly different approaches at different times in the game (early vs. late), including tree-ordering, alpha-beta pruning and other possible techniques.</li>

<li>Extending the winning sequence by 1 results in the possibility of more complex heuristics to score each game state, allowing for various strategies including trap-setting such a double, open-ended 3's.</li>
</ul>
